# Package astrbot_plugin_user_gateway into an AstrBot-installable zip.
#
# Design notes (learned from sibling plugins, keep them):
#   1) EXPLICIT include list. New top-level .py modules MUST be added here too,
#      otherwise the repo has the file but the released zip silently misses it
#      (the feature then just does not work for users).
#   2) Refuse to overwrite an existing zip of the same version: bump the version
#      in metadata.yaml (and add a CHANGELOG entry) before repacking. Historical
#      zips in dist/ are kept forever so users can roll back.
#   3) Archive layout: wrapped in a top-level folder named after the plugin, with
#      explicit directory entries and forward slashes. Do NOT use PowerShell
#      Compress-Archive (it omits directory entries).
#   4) dist/ is git-ignored: the zip is a local install artifact, not source.
#
# Usage: powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build_zip.ps1
#
# NOTE: keep this file ASCII-only. PS 5.1 on a non-UTF8 code page can mis-parse
#       UTF-8 no-BOM files that contain CJK comments.
